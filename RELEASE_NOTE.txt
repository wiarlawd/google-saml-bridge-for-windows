Introduction
------------
This version was built using Microsoft Visual Studio 2005. There are quite some differences in the binary output. If you are upgrading, you need to clean up the 
existing folders and copy over the new ones.  If you'd like to build from source code, you'll need Microsoft Visual Studio 2005. Previous releases were built using Visual 
Studio 2003.

Summary of Changes
---------------------------------
This patch contains fixes for the following issues in the connector:

--Issue #8 Saml Bridge throws an exception when performing an authorization check on a folder/directory. Now SAML Bridge checks file's ACL instead of trying to open a file or folder.
--Issue #9 Saml Bridge throws an exception when performing an authorization check on a file in use.

New Features
---------------------------------
Version 1.5 allows error pages or error codes to be used when something goes wrong. For example, some applications use IIS plugin so that when user is not authorized, he/she 
will be redirected to an error page. Previous versions couldn't detect this type of denial. Now you can configure the SAML Bridge to recognize such permission denial.
